# Card Matching Game
This game requires the player to guess the two matching sets of cards in least number of guesses possible.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

This project really makes use of adding and removing classes to give the impression of the cards flipping over. Classes are also used in the jQuery to determine if a match has been made.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Originally, I had each possible on click combination accounted for in the JavaScript but this was super difficult to maintain. I refactored the on click JS into one ternary expression.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned the importance of doing some refactoring before the project was finished to make it easier to tackle future problems.
